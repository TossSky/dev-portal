# What is Airdrop?

Airdrop is the **process of distributing tokens or cryptocurrencies** for free to users who meet certain criteria. Within the **SingularityNET ecosystem** and its spin-off projects, airdrops play a key role in distributing tokens to the community to encourage participation and support for decentralized initiatives.

Currently, there are two active airdrops available in the SingularityNET ecosystem: Loyalty Rewards and Rejuve.AI Airdrop.

For more information about each airdrop, you can consult the official documentation.
