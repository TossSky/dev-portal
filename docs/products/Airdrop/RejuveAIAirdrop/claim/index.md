# How to Claim Your Tokens?  

1. **Wait for the claim window to open:** After registering in an epoch, the claim window will open in approximately one month.  
2. **Request your tokens:**  
   - You can request tokens immediately or accumulate them and claim them later (e.g., at the end of the fourth epoch to save on fees).  
   - To make a request, connect your **Cardano wallet** and sign the transaction.  
3. **Receive your tokens:** RJV tokens will be sent to your **Cardano wallet**.  

**Tip:** If you plan to claim tokens from multiple epochs at once, ensure that you have registered for each of them.
