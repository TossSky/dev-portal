# Rejuve.AI Airdrop  

As part of SingularityNET’s Phase II initiative, **Rejuve.AI** will distribute **5% of its total RJV token supply** to **AGIX token holders**. This distribution is designed to reward early supporters and long-term holders of **SingularityNET’s AGIX token**.  

A total of **50 million RJV tokens** have been allocated for this purpose, with **25 million RJV tokens available for claiming** across four distribution phases, referred to as **epochs**. The airdrop will take place over **one year** from **March 3, 2025, to February 28, 2026**, giving eligible users the opportunity to register and claim their tokens.  

## How the Rejuve.AI Airdrop Works  

- You must register in each epoch to claim your tokens. If you miss the registration for a specific epoch, you will **not** be able to claim tokens for that period.  
- You can **claim your tokens immediately** or **wait and claim them later**. If you choose to claim tokens separately for each epoch, please note that a **transaction fee will be charged each time**. Alternatively, you can accumulate all tokens and **claim them in the final epoch** by paying the fee only once.  
- Registration only requires signing a message, so there is **no blockchain transaction fee** involved (except when using a **Ledger wallet on Cardano**, which requires a paid transaction).  
- You can join at **any** epoch (1-4) – eligibility is determined based on **wallet snapshots**.  
- There is **NO minimum** amount of AGIX required to participate in the airdrop! The only requirement is to have an AGIX balance based on **the snapshot taken on April 4, 2024**.
