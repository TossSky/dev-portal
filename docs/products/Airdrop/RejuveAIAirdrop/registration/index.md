# Register for Rejuve.AI Airdrop

## Reward Claiming Instructions

**Network for Claiming**
- Rewards can **only** be claimed on the **Cardano network**. Ensure you connect a **Cardano-compatible wallet** to claim your airdropped tokens.

**Wallet-Specific Rewards**
- If you connect an **eligible Cardano address** to claim rewards linked to an **Ethereum address**, you will **not** automatically receive rewards for the **Cardano address itself**.
- **Each eligible wallet** (Cardano or Ethereum) must be connected **separately** to claim its associated rewards.
- Rewards are **not combined** across multiple wallets.

## How to Register?  

1. **Go to the Airdrop Portal:** Visit the [Rejuve.AI Airdrop Portal](https://rejuve-airdrop.singularitynet.io/) (active from March 3, 2025).  
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet (if applicable):**

   - If you held **SingularityNET's AGIX tokens on Ethereum**, connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., **MetaMask**) to verify eligibility.

   - If you held **AGIX tokens on Cardano**, you can verify eligibility directly using your **Cardano wallet**, without needing to connect an Ethereum wallet.  
3. **Link your Cardano wallet:**
   - Once eligibility is confirmed, link your **Cardano wallet** (e.g., **Eternl, Lace, Gero, Flint, Yoroi**) to enable claiming.

4. **Confirm your eligibility:** The system will check whether you held **AGIX tokens at the time of the snapshot on April 4, 2024**.  
5. **Register:** Sign the transaction (**no fees required**, except when using **Ledger** on **Cardano**).

### **Important Notes:**  
- Registration is required for each epoch. If you miss registration during a certain epoch, you will **not** be able to receive tokens for this period, but you can register in the next epoch.  
- AGIX token holders on Ethereum must complete all three steps:  
  ✅ **Connect ETH wallet** → ✅ **Link Cardano wallet** → ✅ **Claim on Cardano**  
- AGIX token holders on Cardano can verify eligibility directly using their **Cardano wallet** and do **not** need to connect an Ethereum wallet first.
