Your `API Key` is ready for use to interact with Ethereum Network. 

After obtaining your `API Key`, you can use the following RPC endpoints to interact with Ethereum networks:

- **Mainnet (Ethereum main network):**  
  ```
  https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>
  ```

- **Sepolia (Ethereum test network):**  
  ```
  https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>
  ```

Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the API key you copied from the Alchemy Dashboard.

These endpoints allow your application to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, send transactions, query data, and more.
