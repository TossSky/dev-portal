# User Guide: Creating and Publishing UI
This guide will help you navigate the interface and use the platform to create UI for services, which can then be published on the marketplace. You will learn how to start a project, write and preview your UI, compile it, and export it for deployment.

## Getting Started
### When You First Visit
When you first visit the platform without logging in, you will see the **Unauthorized User** screen 
To proceed, you need to log in or register. **This is the account that you use to log in to the marketplace.**

### Homepage Overview
After logging in, the Homepage will appear. Here, you can choose how to start:

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/Sandbox/interface-overview/Homepage.webp" alt="Homepage"/>

* ***New Project*** – Creates an almost empty UI source file for a new project.
* ***Open Project*** – Opens the file system, allowing you to select a .zip archive containing UI project files.
* ***Open Templates*** – Provides a selection of pre-made UI templates that can be customized for your service (e.g., Text to Text). (For more details, refer to our [Templates Guide](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/Sandbox/templates-overview/)).
* ***Open Example*** – Loads a ready-to-use UI for a test service, which can be compiled and explored.

Below are the respective screens for each option:

Open project:

## Working in the Editor
Once you choose an option, you will enter the main workspace. The interface is divided into two sections:

### Left Panel – Code Editor
This section allows you to create and modify your UI code.

#### File Management

* Click (+) to create a new file.
* Click (↑) to upload files.

* Click the **Eye Icon** to toggle file visibility:
    * ***Fully open eye*** – All files are visible.

    <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/Sandbox/interface-overview/FullyOpenEye.webp" alt="Fully open eye"/>

    * ***Half-closed eye*** – Some files are hidden.

    <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/Sandbox/interface-overview/HalfOpenEye.webp" alt="Half-closed eye"/>

    * ***Crossed-out eye*** – All files are hidden.

#### Code Display Settings
Below the file management buttons, you can adjust:

* Font size
* Line spacing

### Right Panel – UI Preview & Resources
The right panel has three tabs:

* ***Preview*** – Displays the compiled UI. Initially, it shows "Nothing here yet".

* ***Library*** – Contains UI components and their descriptions.

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/Sandbox/interface-overview/LibrarySection.webp" alt="Library section"/>

* ***Templates*** – Provides ready-to-use UI solutions.

## Compiling Your UI
Once your UI code is ready, click Compile.

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/Sandbox/interface-overview/CompileButton.webp" alt="Compile button"/>

* Enter **OrgID**, **ServiceID**, and **Endpoint**.
* Ensure you have **MetaMask** installed in your browser.
* If everything is correct, your UI will be displayed.

## Saving and Publishing
* Click **Export Project** in the header or use **Ctrl+S** to download your UI as a .zip archive.

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/Sandbox/interface-overview/ExportProject.webp" alt="Export project button"/>
