# What is the Bridge?

The **SingularityNET Bridge** allows users to transfer their tokens across supported blockchains.

---

### Supported Tokens
- **AGIX**  
- **NTX**  
- **FET (ASI)**  
- **WMTX**  
- **RJV**  
- **CGV**

---

### How the Bridge Works

The bridge allows users to transfer tokens between **Ethereum** and **Cardano**. For example:
- Move `AGIX-ETH` from an Ethereum wallet to `AGIX-ADA` in a Cardano wallet.  
- Transfer tokens similarly for `NTX`, `FET`, `WMTX`, `RJV`, and `CGV`.

#### Token Transfer Process:
1. **Ethereum to Cardano**  
   - Ethereum-based tokens are **burned** in a smart contract.  
   - An equal amount of tokens is **minted** on Cardano for you.

2. **Cardano to Ethereum**  
   - Cardano-based tokens are **burned**.  
   - The same amount of tokens is **minted** on Ethereum, ready for you to claim.
