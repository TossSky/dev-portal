The Bridge supports the transfer of tokens between the Ethereum and Cardano networks.  
⚠️ **Important:** Transfers are only possible for identical tokens (e.g., AGIX on Ethereum to AGIX on Cardano).  

Currently supported tokens:  

- **AGIX**  
- **NTX**  
- **FET (ASI)**  
- **WMTX**  
- **RJV**  
- **CGV** 

Once you have selected the chain and the direction of conversion, use the token dropdown to select the token to convert.
