# Instructions for Using the Training

This guide will walk you through the steps to train or fine-tune a model using the services provided. Depending on your needs, you can either use an existing model or create a fine-tuned model from your dataset. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## 1. If You Already Have a Model:
1. Register or log in to your account at [https://beta.singularitynet.io/](https://beta.singularitynet.io/).
2. Select a service that has the training function enabled.

You can find out if training is available for this service in this section:

3. Go to the **Models** tab.

4. Click **Request a New Model**.
5. Enter the name and description of the model, and upload your prepared dataset.

6. Click **Create** and confirm the signature in MetaMask.
7. Wait until the training process is completed (status should show **Completed**).

8. Click **Inference** and make a service call using the trained model and wait.

## 2. If You Want to Fine-Tune your datasets:
1. Register or log in to your account at [https://beta.singularitynet.io/](https://beta.singularitynet.io/).
2. Select a service that has the training function enabled.

You can find out if fine-tuning is available for this service in this section:

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/Marketplace/CorrectService.webp" alt="Service with fine-tuning"/>

3. Go to the **Data Preset** tab.

4. Upload your dataset.
5. If there are any issues, you will have the option to fix them by clicking **Improvement Options**.

8. If you have another dataset, you can combine it with the current dataset:
   1. Add the second dataset on the right and improve it.

   2. Click **Merge** to combine the datasets.
